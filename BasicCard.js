/* ==This file should define a Node module that exports a constructor for creating basic flashcard, e.g. 'module.exports=BasicCard;'
===== The constructor should accept two arguments: 'front' and 'back'.
===== The constructed objects should have a 'front' property that contains the text on the front of the card.
===== The constructed objects should have a 'back' property that contains the text on the back of the card.
